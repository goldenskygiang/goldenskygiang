## Hi there üëã

I am Truong Giang, a Master's student in Computer and Information Science (MSE/CIS) at the University of Pennsylvania. Also, I ~am completing my senior year~ have just graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at VinUniversity.

I have experience in developing back-end systems in ASP.NET Core, Django and FastAPI, from personal projects to nationwide-deployed systems at work.

In addition, I also do a bit of machine learning through research projects in Differential Privacy and Federated Learning.
