## Hi there üëã

I am Giang, a software engineer at Bloomberg Industry Group!

Prior to that, I graduated with a Master's degree at the University of Pennsylvania, and a Bachelor's degree at VinUniversity, both in the same Computer Science major.

~~I have experience in developing back-end systems in ASP.NET Core, Django and FastAPI, from personal projects to nationwide-deployed systems at work.
In addition, I also do a bit of machine learning through research projects in Differential Privacy and Federated Learning. Frontend dev sucks.~~ As long as it is code, I can do it (hopefully)!
